== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Whats up with this "Push" thing?


 The Microsoft Push Notification Service (MPN) in Windows Phone offers third party developers a resilient, dedicated, and persistent channel to send information and updates to a Windows Phone application from their web sites (web services).
In the past, a mobile application would need to frequently poll its corresponding web service to know if there are any pending notifications. While effective, polling results in the device radio being frequently turned on, impacting battery life in a negative way. By using push notifications instead of polling, a web service can notify an application of important updates on an as-needed basis.
